= Simple TCP Server

Starts a text based TCP server on a designated port on all interfaces and provides the following:

* Every conection is serviced on a dedicated thread.
* Periodically sends a message to a client and expects the client provide a response, see xref:unsolicited-requests[]
  for more information.
* Accepts client requests in the form of `KEY:VALUE`, see xref:recognized-requests[] for more information.
* Client requests are provided with a response of the form `KEY:VALUE`.

== Recognized Requests

* `0820` will result in a response `0830:time=DATETIME` where `DATETIME` will be the date time stamp of the server.

== Unsolicited Requests

This is the server sending a request to a client. The client is expected to provide a response.

Every 5 seconds the server will send a message:

* `0120:timee=TIMESTAMP` where `TIMESTAMP` will be the current date, time and time zone of the server.
